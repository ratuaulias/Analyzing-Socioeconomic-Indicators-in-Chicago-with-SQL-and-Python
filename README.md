# Analyzing-Socioeconomic-Indicators-in-Chicago-with-SQL-and-Python

This project explores socioeconomic indicators in Chicago using SQL and Python. It leverages data analysis techniques to understand the relationships between various socioeconomic factors such as per capita income, unemployment rate, and poverty levels. By using SQL for data extraction and Python for visualization and analysis, the project provides insights into how these factors are interconnected.

##Key Features:
1. Data Exploration: Querying data from a database to extract relevant socioeconomic indicators.
2. Data Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between variables such as per capita income, unemployment rate, and poverty levels.
3. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to better understand trends and correlations in the data.
4. Outlier Detection: Identifying regions or data points that deviate from the expected patterns.
5. SQL Queries: Writing SQL queries to retrieve and filter data from a dataset of Chicago's socioeconomic indicators.

##Technologies Used:
SQL: For querying the database and extracting relevant socioeconomic data.
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Jupyter Notebook: For executing and documenting the analysis process.
